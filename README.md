# Melittoflora Plant-Pollinator Network Visualisation

The Melittoflora tool is an initiative of the [Oregon Bee Project](https://www.oregonbeeproject.org/) and is
described more fully on its [dedicated page](https://agsci.oregonstate.edu/bee-atlas/melittoflora) on the OSU website for
the [Oregon Bee Atlas](https://agsci.oregonstate.edu/bee-atlas)

You can access the Melittoflora Tool at

This tool is built on a biodiversity visualisation platform initiated by [IMERSS](https://imerss.org/), the 
Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological Research in the Salish Sea and is part of a ecology of similar visualisation
tools which can be browsed on their [Biodiversity Visualisations Portal](https://imerss.github.io/imerss-bioinfo/).
